**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
  The Gaming Room Client came to our agency looking to turn their local gaming application into an application that would serve a variety of new clients including mobile. They had specifications about the content (including high resolution images) to be served. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
  In this documentation, I did a good job of describing the multiple options and rationale behind recommending a distributed architecture for the client.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
  I found the proces of working through the document helpful as it required me to dig into the details of operating systems, architectures, and to take a stance on the best solution for the project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
  If I had to choose a particular section to improve, it would likely be the Domain Model analysis. I would like to further analyze the solution to come up with a more natural description for the client, though I do feel like the solution I provided was accurate.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
  I made considerations for the client the primary concern in these recomendations, including considerations for application-level design and overall system architecture, including considerations for scalability, redundancy, security, local client performance, and mobile bandwidth. If it weren't for the client, we would be nothing, and the game would either be shortlived, faulty, or not appealing to the end user, so considering the user and client's need are paramount. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
  The primary technique used to design the software were considerations about the aforementioned security and availability. I recommended caching in several areas of the solution to ensure smooth operation of the system and applications. In the future I would continue to prioritize these factors, digging deeper to outline the local solutions of each component.
